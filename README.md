# HOW TO ACCESS DEMO
# Camera Registration System

This project is a Camera Registration System developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (including npm)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/camera-registration-system.git
    cd camera-registration-system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install

    # Install client dependencies
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure MongoDB:**

    - Make sure MongoDB is running locally.
    - Update the MongoDB connection string in `backend/config/database.js` if needed.

4. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    # Start the server (from the 'backend' directory)
    cd backend
    node src/app.js

    # Start the client (from the 'frontend' directory)
    cd ../frontend
    start index.html
    ```

5. **In case it doesn't opened:**

    - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Additional Notes

- The application uses the MERN stack, with React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.
- Make sure to set up Google Maps API key in the frontend (`frontend/js/script.js`) for map functionality.
- Adjust the paths and configurations as needed for your specific setup.
